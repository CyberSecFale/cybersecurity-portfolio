# 🧠 Journal Entry  
### **"No Loops, No Leftovers — The GitHub Résumé Battle"**  
📅 **May 23, 2025**

## What Happened

What started as a simple résumé upload turned into a five-hour GitHub puzzle involving broken Markdown links, file paths across repositories, folder shuffles, and multiple rounds of troubleshooting.

I was just trying to make my Cybersecurity Portfolio look clean.  
Instead, I found myself deep in the trenches of version control madness.

---

## What Went Wrong

- I moved `resume.md` into the `/projects` folder… which broke links because GitHub treats top-level files and nested ones differently.
- Tried linking to a PDF résumé hosted in a separate repo. GitHub wouldn’t allow relative links across repos.
- Used shield badges and image-linked PDFs that didn’t render properly in GitHub markdown.
- Went through at least **three major Markdown rewrites**.

## What We Fixed

✅ Created a **direct link to résumé PDF** using the `raw` GitHub URL  
✅ Kept `resume.md` and the downloadable PDF in their own **dedicated repository**  
✅ Used this link (and verified it works across devices):  
[📄 Download Résumé PDF](https://github.com/CyberSecFale/resume.md/raw/main/Resume05212025321am.pdf)

✅ Restored every broken Markdown project file by creating placeholders:
- `security-audit.md`
- `network-analysis.md`
- `linux-permission.md`
- `sql-filters.md`
- `vulnerability-assessment.md`
- `incident-journal.md`
- `professional-statement.md`

✅ Ensured all **Quick Navigation** links work  
✅ Kept the formatting clean for recruiters

## Why It Mattered

This wasn't just a tech issue—it was a **professional credibility issue**.

I want recruiters to open my GitHub and instantly see:
- A working résumé
- Valid links
- Organized files
- Clean documentation

And I want it to **reflect what I stand for**:  
🔐 Persistence. Clarity. Security.

## Credit Where It’s Due

Even **J.A.K. (Justified AI Knowledge)**—my personal AI assistant—was feeling the heat on this one.

We both pushed through every bug, every 404 error, every busted path.

And now it works.  
**CyberWolf001 approved.** 🐺💻
